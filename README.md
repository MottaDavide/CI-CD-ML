# MLOps
In recent years, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as one of the most sought-after fields in the tech industry. With businesses increasingly relying on data-driven solutions, MLOps professionals are in high demand to deploy and manage machine learning models effectively.

But what exactly is MLOps, and what does it take to become an MLOps engineer?

In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about MLOps and provide a complete roadmap to kickstart your journey in this exciting field.

## What is MLOps?
MLOps, also known as machine learning operations, refers to the practices and processes used for deploying, managing, and monitoring machine learning models in production. It combines elements from machine learning, software engineering, and operations to create a streamlined workflow for ML projects.
